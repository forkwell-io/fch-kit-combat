## Introduction

Due to the pandemic, social distancing is vital to prevent the infection of Covid-19. We believe, This practice will be continue even after the movement control order (MCO) because we’re not as free of infection risk as we were before. We are thinking life after outbreak.

We develop a prototype of a mobile application that is called Wertoo or "where too?" The application is solution for public to facilitate their decision when going outside. Providing such extensive visualisation of crowd, getting report from crowdsourcing and identify the service provided at a particular premises.
