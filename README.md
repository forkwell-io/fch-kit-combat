## Background

WHO has outlined key actions for managing pandemics; testing, tracking, tracing, isolation and
quarantine. Governments around the world are applying these key actions to cope with the spread of
disease but appear to be inadequate with the scale of the outbreak. We as individuals can play a
substantial role in combating this outbreak. With the help of modern technologies, we can realise
these actions effectively.

Developing a tool targeted for government, authorities, communities, and individuals are all
acceptable. Teams with the winning prototype will automatically get **wildcard** placement in
[Sunway iLab's Super Accelerator](https://innovationlabs.sunway.edu.my/accelerator/) program to
realise the prototype at scale!

## Goal

Build web-based or mobile apps to help nations cope with the outbreak.

1. Identify worrying trends by applying AI and Big Data techniques to publicly available datasets.
2. Propose and develop a prototype that helps nations alleviate these worrying trends.
3. Showcase your proposal and prototype.

## Submission

You are required to submit a 15-minute presentation video of your report. However, to ensure the
legitimacy of your submission, you are required to submit your project artifacts (code, datasets,
documents) as a [fork](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) to this repository.

After creating your own [fork](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/), clone your
repository:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:<your-github-username>/fch-virus-combat
```

Change to the directory:

```sh
cd fch-virus-combat
```

Set upstream:

```sh
git remote add upstream git@github.com:forkwell-io/fch-virus-combat
```

...and start Hacking!!

Once you are ready to submit, create a pull request from your
[fork](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) to us and include the link to your fork in
your submission form that will be available on the 14th of April 2020.
